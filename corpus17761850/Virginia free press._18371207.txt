* THE CURRENCY. ^
From llio Letter received by last
evening’. Express Mail bom our cor
respondent in New York, our leaders
will learn that the Convention of Dele
***** Iron; the IJan'.s, which met on
j Tuesday last in tiie city of New York.
'• likely to determine that it u inexpe
dient „t present to lix upon a day for
tin* lesumplioo of specie pay.neuU. and,
jpvihipc, also to detenniae upon some
!day on which the Convention will ie
aa>eriib!« lo consider the subject,
j U'e Jid not expect any different de
j vision on the main que-ti >n by the Con
vention than that which u indicated:
because, having considered the matter
with the iro.'t serious attention, we do
not believe that the Banks gentnilly
are in a condition to resume payment,
uluesj with the hearty aid and co-ope
rati in o! th«* Government, which, in
stead of lending its aid, continues to
how a not only upon the delinquent
■ Ranks, hut upon the whole fabric of our
] commercial system, ol which they cou
i stitute an essential p »rt.
Nor do we believe that a restoration
of specie payments is to be ctfected by
revidutionsot any Convention; in which
impre ssion we urc sustained by the his
tory ol the resumption of specie pay
ments twenty years ago, after the Go
vernment had, by its improvident and
unwise legislation, (or refusal to legis
Jate,) placed the Banks of the country*
in a position in which they were obliged
to suspend specie payments. Conven
tions were held at that time, and they
ended, as this Convention has result
ed, in doing nothing. But. afterwards,
the Government having come to its
senses, and resorted to its power to ie
gulate the currency by th« establish
ment of a Bank ol the L’uited Stales,
the resumption of specie pav menu
came as a matter of course, and wo .Id
have continued to this day, if the ex
ecutive of the L’nited Slates had not,
in the deleriuin of infixed ignorance,
and In the mod arbitrary spirit, resort
ed to the veto power to break dow n
anj destroy the very be-t currency and
the most prosperous comtncicc tin
world has ever seen.
Now, as heretofore, it i- the Govern
ment which mu-t lend its aid to the
resumption of sperii* psyments bv th.
banks, without which it ran not *..f«dv
b« attempted. We do not mean by
the establishment of a Natiir.il Bank:

£01 ie of our hrethirn o» the press,

an- very busy in explaining the cause
“* their defeat, and the triumph of the
Whig.. One imputes it to inattention.

threii a hearty welcome to all the.e
and will lend them a file of the United

which they may find a hundred more_
for long practice made 11. very expert
in excuses of thi. kind. We nev.-r
knew our party to he defeated, without
assigning sortie good reason. New
Jer.ey went, and we told the people
a rout the unlucky division among the
Friends—Connecticut yielded to the
Loco Focos, anil the misrepresentations
"I Dr. Miles were assigned—Rhode
I.land hull,lord for Jackson, and we
.aw plainly that our opponent, had
bribed the Anti Masons—Kentucky
I IOkl «»cr vote, and Mr. Clay was absent
; —an^ *° we went on accounting lor
I defeats, and comforting the defeated,
laughing half the lime, as we thought
^ i»t Sheri Jan * story of shooting witn
the Irish game keeper.
Sheridan fned into a fine Hock ol
partridge*, and mined them all
"Weltdone,” si»id the game keeper,
‘'they'll remember that.”
Sheridan shot anmu with the same
success.
k our honor inaks a fine noise with
a gun. said Patrick.
A third shot, and no birds dead.
"That stung their., I ll warrant it,"
•aid the good natured game keeper.
After some forty or fifty similar fail
urcs. Sheridan grew weary, and disco
vered like wi»e that the worthy game
keeper was running short of his kind
of ammunition.
Asa last chance, the sporting states
man drew upon a flock of pheasants,
within a few yard* of the inu/zle of
his gun. The birds dcSibetately rose
and llew away. Sheridan turned to
hear what the game keeper Could say
to that.
.luiirs. i .urirK warcnen trie Might
of the bird*, and then turning to Sheri
dan, said, "your honor made them get
out of that.”
And this ha* hern the melanrholy
duty of some V\ hig editors fur year*.
The tatdrs aie turned, and the Loro
k or os must try the tame course. We
repeat our offer, and would advise them
not to lorget it. 1 hey may mu«ter up
excuse* for the present defeat, hut a
surce*Mon of ten or twelve \ear» will
certainly exhaust their resource*—and
while we have the chance of huzzaing
