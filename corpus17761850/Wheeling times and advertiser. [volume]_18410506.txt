■Spcriu Oil ..nd one of Webb's Patent Caiuphine
Lamps, with a measured quantity of Webb's C’ani

ihe quantity ol light afforded by eorh every twenty
minutes, tor two liours, and tinnlly ineiiMiring Ihe
residual quantity ol Oil ami Cnni|4iine, determined
ihe quaintly ol each consumed. Front these data I
calculated the proportion of each suletam-e ncrcs
snry to afford an equal light. The result, was. that
lj |»nris of Camphinc were equal in illuminating
power to 100 purls of Oil, by measure. Allow ing
Imtb siilMtanres lo be of equal price by the gnllon,
there would he a sav ing ol more than one-half by
u»ing ihe Caiuphine. Suns idea of the superior
brilliancy ol the light front ihe Camphine may lie
formed from Ihe lacl that in tho above experiment
although the diameter of Ihe iwo flame* wu not
very different, the one being seven-eighths and the I
other nine-eighths of an inch; yet tho light from the
Oil was to llml from Iho Caiuphine only ns 3 lo 10,
