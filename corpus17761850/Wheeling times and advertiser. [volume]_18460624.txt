PRAIRIE INDIANS.
A cotn|mny of Indian Chiefs of the various
Tribe* that go under the name of Prairie In
diana went up the river on the New England
on Monday on their way to Washington.
Some of them were good looking, well built
men; but they were about as near the stale
of nuturc us they could well be. Many of
them would wear no I lollies hut th»i»
eta ami half the time would appear entirely
naked.” They were accompanied by 2 Creek*
and 10 white men.
For the Times.
Mr. Editor:—In my communication of
Monday, but few remarks were made upon
Rial top Chase's circular to bin brethren of the
Protestant Epi*seoj»al Church, because 1 did
not then, nor do 1 now, conceive tliat any
inora were necessary. Rut the opinion ex
pensed in the article aubjoined to my first ar
ticle—fit which corresponded in this, & in ev
ery other particular with my own, viz; that
that document wore the apjiearauce of a de
aigu on tlm part of the uuthor to browbeat
hia brethren, and thus as it were, during them
to say aught to the contrary of bis dictum,
has been much strengthened by a perusal of
tliat letter a second and a third time. And,
may add, I will be m'Jch surprised if some, at i
least, of our Right Reverend Fathers, in their
fidelity to tha Church, do not imitate St.
Paul, when he withstood St. Peter to Uie
face, “because he uus to be blamed."
As I remarked before, Hisho|i Onderdouk
did not -receive the Professorship as Bishop,
or even as a clergyman. And the Trustees
luring refused to remove Shi in from that of
lice, or eiculocall a meetng to considerof
bis removal, they recognised his right to give
iiMtruction as htietofore, and also that of
thcstikieiiia to attend him. Rut, from mo
tives of delicacy, he discontinued tlie servi
ces which he had given the Seminary gratui
tously for years, immediately upon his sus
pension; and though, by the vote of the rep
resentatives of the Church ut large, he has had
*Ttrffct right to continue in the exercise of
his office, and has been repeatedly solicited
to do so; yet he tia* abstained from tbe one,
an I refused to gratify the other—neither ad
ding to, or diminishing aught from, the
atricl aeua* of theoru'lr.siaalical sentence. I
And yet, notwithstanding this most Chris
turn and Churchmanlike behavior, must this
venerable old man be dragged from the seclu
aion to which lie had retired, and where none
but hia most intimate friends were admitted,
and held up to the scorn and indignation of
hit enemies, and lo be a gazing stor k for all
who nei liter know him or care ought for his
sorrows? Must this infirm and aged Prel

and Christian project of “having spies in New

matter before, writing hin letter, common

The following article would never have ap
(teared before the public, were it not for the
da*Urd>y attack of some individuals on iny
literary character. It waa delivered at an ex
hibition in West Alexandria on the 18lh of
Sept. 184b, ami aa there waa only a abort
spate ol time allowed for the delivery of each
speech—namely twelve ininntea. 1 was of
necesnityobliged to hr as oratorical and florid
in point of iuiagnry and sentiments aa the
seriousness of the subject would admit of.—
In what a perverted and mutilated form it
came before the public, a discriminating corn
munity can at once perceive, by comparing
with the present one, the speech |«alined up
oil t lie i wo pie as iniiKs, fit which was publish
ed in the Wheeling Times on the 2nd of De
cember 1845.
Ami now, Mr. Klitnr, permit ine to mukc
a few remarks relative to the tatentn, mttrul
character, and ^landing, of the “Illuminati,’
who have undertaken the arrangement and
amendment of a speech piirpurtiug to be a
production of mine, in making the observa
tions, however,which I may have occasion
to make. 1 wish it to be literally understood
that they do not proceed from a spirit of vin
dictiveness, or retaliation, but come from a
heart justly incensed by an unprovoked, un
merited, and malicious outrage—In conse
quence of which I c msider it my imperative
duty to inform the community that~l}is is
not an isolated dead, but the exciting cause
by its bringing to a focus that those organiza
tions which have been in existence for years,
in the exhibition of all the contemptible and
nefarious articles and surmises that could
hava been engendered in the hellish forge ol
phrensied envy and puerile malice. They
have never dared to assail iny character, be
caus" there is more fsnvihilit* ,-«ll
account; and punish the imp acher of it than
there is in any man,* public character “when
like a moral pestilence before their breath,
I the healthy blooms ami shoots of social joy
and happiness decoyed.” And now a word
to you news mongers, and underling emissa
ries of Satan, and to you gulled and transport
ed leaders, who knowingly lent yourselves as
a kind of devilish toolism to blast the influ
ence of those powers of mind upon which,
God himself has indubitable claims. In con -
elusion, as a duty 1 owe to myself, my friends,
my country and iny God. 1 appeal to a gen
erous, enlightened and magnauimions, pub
lic, whether you will suffer society thus to
become degenerate, and corrupt, and have
the inviolable right of yourselves and others
to be basely an<l recklessly trampled upon.—
Now I ask by all that is sacred upon earth,
md 1 appeal with reverence to the high
-•ourt of lieaveu for a restoration of these pub
ic tights on which you all have a claim* and
which Iwve been wantonly, recklessly, and (
fiendishly wrested from one. I

GEN ERA I, TAYLOR.
Ill reply toi qimtiik xvlretlrer we intend
to be present at tire meeting to-night, to nom
inate Gen. Taylor to the Presidency—we an
swer null*Mtaiinglv, no; and for tire very best
nl all reasons—no friend of (ten. Tavi.ok
should attend that meeting, but leave it entire
ly to the direction and control of that class
of nren, who engage in politics with ulterior
selfish rirtev.
At this moment, every man, woman and
child, not only in this city, Isit throughout
the entire land, (always excepting those who
cannot rejoice ox er the defeat of tin* enemies
of our country.) is tire friend of Gen. Taylor.
Place him in nomination for tire Presidency
by a meeting of Whigs ut our Whig Head
Quarters. and what then xvill be his position?
General lax lor has served his country no
bly, and is at this moment doing her good ser
vice; and is it to he tolerated, that noxxr.when
all men of all parlies, are unanimous in his
praise, that any aetof selfish politicians, mere
ly to have it in their poxve.rto say, these were
Jirut in the field—ahull Ire countenanced in
depriving the Hero of Palo Alto ami Resca
de la Palma, of the good xvill and gratitude of
any portion ol hislellow citizens? What right
have any set of men. lor any purpose whatev
er, thus to injure and possibly destroy, the fu
ture prospects of one xvho so richly merits
the kindly feelings and sympathy ol all his
fellow citizens?
Of Gen. Taylor lire country knows but lit
tle, save from Ids victories; and we confess
Uwt the modest manner in xvhich his despatch
fa chronicle those victories, indicate a fituesa
for tire Presidency xx hich cannot he found in
the. victories themselves. And we confess,
two, our conviction, that such is the |«ssion
of our people lor military glory—such tlreii
gratitude to those who have served their coun
try in lire field, that we xvould rather have
Gen. Taylor’s chances for tire Presulency than
j those of any man living. Ilul once put him
in nomination for the Presidency—oncearray
him against the. administration in poxver—
once compel all the supporters of that admin
istration, to look ii|>«>ii him as a political ri
val—a Whig candidate for the Presidency—
and his chances xvill dxviudlc doxvn to noth
Such being our convictions, we hold that no
friend of tin: General's, should loan himself to
this proceeding. It !»c now has chances for
ll»e Presidency, those chances will most cer
tainly, be less when lie is made to o<-cupy a
false position. Hut says one—“Tlie Tamma
ny Society intend to make him a Sachem, and
seduce bun from us!” Will such an act by
Tanunnny, seduce him from his principles?
If not, it ran do no harm; if it will, lie is un
worthy of being a Whig candidate. It he is
strong now, and justly strong, time can only
increase that strength. It is plain that the
Whigs cannot elect him by their votes; and
yet the men who desired this meeting, would
deprive him of the opjrortunily of obtaining
t confidence and support of our opponents.
Was there ever greater madness?
Hut aside from all policy, it iscruel to Gen.
oral Taylor to deprive him of the universal
gratitude and good will now felt for him,and
which is destined to increase from day to
day. In his name therefore—in the name of
a gallant aoldier who thinks only of discharg
ing his whole duty to the country, regardless
of party—we solemnly protest against his
nomination for the Presidency. Let him a
lone. Let him go on as lie lias begun, and
the People will in their own preqier time,
tiring him forward for any station they desire
»im to occupy. To place him in nomination
iom», is not only to array against him a large
Mjytiou of the people, but we think, certain
Instruction to his future prospects, at the.
♦amt; time that it cannot fail to cripple hisen
ergies and compel hint to occupy a false, po
sition before tlia country, and in relation to
the present ad ini nisi ration under whose orders
he. is acting, and upon whom ihe success of
his ram (align measurably depends, The ad
ministration cannot give, hint success, hut it
is in their power to thwart him in every move
ment. In one word, whoever goes to this
meeting afier due reflection, should be set
down as Ihe enemy and not the friend of Gen
eral Taylor. We have not heard a single
name mentioned in connexion with the mat
ing; and therefore our remark, however true.,
is not aimed at any person in |»orlicular. We
feel however, that llie movement i» ill-limed
and eminently selfish.

SUMMER QUARTERS OF THK ARMY
OF OCCUPATION- MAGNlFlCISNT
PROSPECT.
We learn, from a private letter, lhat Gen.
Taylor has expressed a determination to make
hi* summer quarters at Monterey, and there
is no doubt that with the force now under his
command, and th« volunteers that are hasten
ing to his *tandard, that he can establish his
summer quarters in any part of the eastern
provinces of Mexico that he desires. Tire
vulley of Monterey was runted by many of
our soldiers, during the Federal War, and
th.-y all describe it a* an earthly paradise:
groves of orange, lemons, figs, and pome
granates, surround the city, and the whole
valley, which isirrigjited by countless rivulets
pure aim wiHnrsmw wsier, is a continuous
! K*r<**n, producing various kinds of vetetabU*
and tropical fruita in abundance.
The climate, however, in summer, it rather
too warm to be agreeable to |*r*on* from the
Northern States; but a short distance, in the
elevated plains among the mountaina, the cli
mate, even in midsummer,is aw cool and salu
brious as that of the Catskill mountains,
( Kven the northern fruita, such as the apple,
P"ar, &c., are produced in abundance, in
1 elevated rrapons, Whew our troops
our* get pleasantly located in that delightful
region, they will be very unwilling to leavt
it; and the glowing dearription they will cir
culate throughout the Union, will ere long ex
cite a desire among all dames to annex it to
| the United States. The altipendnous chain
(of the .Sierra Madre is a boundary meet for a
great nation; but the insignificant Rio Bravo
is only mutable to define the limits of State or

cittr. The Cincinnati Commercial has the
following account of the robbery:
“A part of the great Southern mail, stolen
on Sunday morning, the 7th inst., from the
mail bool at this city, between two ami put
four o'clock in the morning, was recovered
into our poet-office yesterday morning: it came
Irom Wheeling. We learned the billowing
particularsat the post-office.yesterday, show
■ ***8 the villains engaged in this robbery
are unparalleled for boldness, impudence and
kcnxI luck. It is now known, pretty certain
,ly, that the great Southern mail was taken
Irom the mail-boat while lying at our wharf,
and put on board the Wisconsin, the Sunday
j mail packet for Pittsburgh. She left here a
bout 10 o'clock, A. MT, that day, during
which time thisstolen mail was on buard, un
known and unmolested, in the stale room oc
I cupied by the thieves, within thirty feet of
where the robbery was committed! The time
it laid in that proximity was at least six hours!
i The thieves had the mail, it is thought, in a
large trunk prepared for the occasion,at least
this is a fair reference.
The Wisconsin arrived at Wheeling at the
usual tima.and the mail robbers, with theii
booty, took rooms at the United States Hotel
Here tliey occupied their time in opening th<
letters and rifling them of their contents with
: out suspicion:
On Wednesday last, a box was taken fron
said hotel at Wheeliug by a negro and a whiti
man, name unknown, and put on board tfw
steamboat Senate, the white man remarking
| k°x .WM hi*, and that he was comini
to Cincinnati. He did not come on board
however, and the box remained on the dacl
I Ui UK 1**11, exposed to the weather, until
Saturday evening last, during which time the.
Senate had made way hither.
The Captain, finding no markon the box,
and supposing it might contain something li
able to damage, he ordered it to be opened.
It contained one canvas mail bag, which was
inside ^ Southern chain nag, stolen on
the 7th inst., as before stated. The box was
put into the hands of the U. S. Marshal.
! ^ is supposed that tire thieves made all
haste East with the drafts, and obtained and
r^cei^ed the money on them, to what amount
is of course unknown. A bolder and more
successful robbery than this was never perpe
trated in the United Stales to our knowledge.
MYSTERIOUS. CIRCUMSTANCE—On
Sunday, says the Boston Transcript,of Tues
day, a son of Mr. Dix, keeper of the draw of
the Warren Bridge, picked up a box about 6
leet long and twenty incites wide; says the
Transcript,on the Boston side of the Charles
river, with the marks of a considerable quan-1
tity of blood, upon the inside, which had soak
ed through, and was plainly risible upon the
other side. Tire box appaientlv had been in
the water but a short time. When first seen
it was bottom up, and the cores was (ranging
on one side and held by one nail. In the act
of hauling it into the boat, a bag stuffed with
hav, and apparently bloody, floated off and
was not recovered. This morning, a man went
down to the bridge, looker! at the box, and
stated to Mr. Dix, that on Saturday evening,
he naw a body taken from thia boa, |>ut into
a coffin, and the coffin tarred. The place
where this occurred he would not state. It
was, probably, not a very reputable place.
IMPORTANT FROM THE PACIFIC.

Vera Crux, having on board John Parrott, Esq.

M. Wood, of the U. S. navy. These gentle
men left Mszatlan on the 30th April, and
crossed Mexico in safety.
AU was quiet at Monterey, in California,
on the 21st April. At Guadalaxaia, Mr. Par
rott ami Dr. Wood sent to Commodore Slow

sesonebly forwarded to him of tire blockade of
the Mexican porta on the Gulf of Mexico —
Our squadron in the Pacific was generally in

THE FATAL CONSEQUENCE,

recorded, and the vast number that die of
Coiisiiinpiion, and the very many of our
friends and acquaintances who are seriously
and dangerously afflicted, and must ere long
pay the debt ot nature* is alone sufficient evi
dence that no time should be lost in getting
clear of the rm first evil seed, of disease as
socb as possible, before it takes root ami des
trooslife. Occular demonstrations arc daily
visible to the public that
“DR. DUNCANS EXPECTORANT
REMEDY" .
is the only safe and effectual medicine tlwt
wilWoinpletcly eradicate the Dial symptoms
of this fatal disease. ,
The Proprietor of Dr. Duucan’s Medicines
w*gai leave to inform Western Patients, sutler
ing from disease, thal lie has opened a Wcst
