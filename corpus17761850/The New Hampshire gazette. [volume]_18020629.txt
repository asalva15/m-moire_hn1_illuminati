sure, that Touffaint, his party and aecom
plices, are arrefled, put in irons, and on
board the frigate Le Creole, bound for
Erance, to anfwer’ for the many crimes he
has committed. The Cape has been illu
minated, and the effigy of Touffaint borne

ragraph we think, was inserted in that
paper, with a view to convey the idea,
that they were removed from the
New-Hampthire Gazerte, which we
are happy to fay, is not the case : Bat
that the Laws of this State, and all
Landed and Public Advertisements
are still by law to be published in the

the general Court, and Journals of the
Senate and House, only in pamphlets.
The Editors of the Gazette, are
happy, in their turn, to observe, that
altho’, they, at fir{}, experienced a small
decrease of subscribers, yet, since it
has been generally known, that “the

o FESTIVAL OF St. FOHN.
" Thursday last being the anoiverfary of
Saint John the Baptist, the fame was cele
brated in this town, by the Most Worthip
ful the Grand Lodge of Newhampthire, 1n
ample form. ‘ .
The craft convened at Jefferfon hall, from
whence the proceflion moved to St. John’s
Church,. where the solemnities of the day
were introduced by prayers. Brother stTob-
DARD delivered a most excellent Oration,
in which he difcanted on illuminifm, clearly
proving that legitimate Lodges of Freema
sonry ever have remained free of that curs
ed infatuation. That the original founders
of the order of Illuminati were not Free and
Accepted Malons ; that they resembled Ma
sons in nothing bat their f{ecrecy ; but that
some few afterwards became Malons, the
better to conceal their infernal priociples.
At inteivals in the performances, the au
ditory, were ¢ntertained with felefl pieces of
mofic.—The Fratérnity then retarped to
Jefferfon Hall, where they feafted ou the
good things of life, and drack their wine
with a cheerful beart; and concluded the
day with songs, &c : ' §

Capital Operation in Surcirr.
‘1 he wife of Mr Joseph Kennilon, of
Woltborough (N.H.) had a laige Schirrhus,
or Cancerous brealt. The swelling and
pain had encreafed to an alarming degree,
Anxicus for life, the consulted some of the
most celebrated of the faculty in the fute.
1o compliance with theis advice, resolved to
try an uncertain remedy, rather than fobmit
to an absolute fate. On Thuifday 15h of
Apnl last, Dr. Asa Adams, of said Welf.
boré®, Dr. A/a Crosby, ot Sandwich ; and a
certain Dr, Huff, of Moultonborough, met
at Mr, Kennifon’s house for the intended
opperation. Mzss. Kennilon, persevering in
her purpose, Dr. 4dams, with his nfuz! caim
nefsand dexterity, began and went thro’ the
operation, completely removing the affc&ted
breast, in 5 minates, which weighed g pounds
&an half. Mrs. Keonifon thro’ the whole
scene manifelted a firmnefs and compofare
highly becoming her profeffion asa disciple
of HiM who has said—" In your patience
poflefs ye your fouls.” It is now just seven
weeks since the opperation : the wound is
perfe&ly healed ; she is in good health, and
able to do the commen bafine(s of her fam
ily.—lt is hoped the foregoing may be (uffi
cient to encourage other {ufferers in a simi
lar case, seasonably 20 try a similar remedy
as there is no doubt but that many valuable
lives have been loft by delay.
