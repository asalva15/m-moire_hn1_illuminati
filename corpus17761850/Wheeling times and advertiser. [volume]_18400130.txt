Having been yeesent at Mr Canning's first loature (
Natural Philosophy on Saturday evening !• *t, tin
lowing allusion* to some of the principal points of
ence touched upon, may not b« uninteresting to «
ur reader*. I ||
On l!»• occasion referred to. there was present a '
* h larger assembly of person* than I eipectod to
eet, in which werv to be s.en several of tlie leading 1 y
id influential gentlemen of the city, and a goodly k
irtion of the fairer part of creation too Mr. I'.'* de. •'
t'vry was good. uikI his illustration* clear : autne |
ins of hi* discourse h-id claim* to eloquence, and
w-ell received. The particular subject of the •
eiure was the general properties of matter, which, al *
tough tt gave but little occ-jaion for cificriinent. wa* r
ite res ling and instructive. '
After en'iiuemting sit properties common h all mat
rr. he dwelt at some length on each The •radrsfrur- 1
of matter he illustrated bv referring to the ef- J
vet of fire on a piece of wood. Seemingly, he said. .
he wood was chiefly eoriMiraed by the fire, yet such
vas not the case—there was not one particle of it dr- |
itmyed ; it was only partially (waived into it* ele- *
Menu; the volatile part* were floating in the atmor. 1
[there above u«. whilst the mere ponderous were lay 1
mg on the hearth Imn.-ath. and all ready to re enter I'
into some new rombminmu of nature. Who knew.

grave of the Father of our country. carries away with
him some of the atom* of win. h his body was compo
sed , ami who k:x>wa but we are even now breathing
some of the air which Hob passed through the lings of
i> ir common father Adam. - There are more thing*
in heaven and earth. Uuratio, than are dreamt of in
your philosophy .**
The dieisiiWi/y of matter he illustrated by calling
the attention of his hearers to the small piece of blue
cured necessary to color u quantity of water, each drop
of wtuih colored water cotitams a po tiou of the vit- 1
rfol, thus showing the great number of panicles into
which the colorific innlli*. i. ,I,.1,I„|

• wamI how
“ Gatiljr by immortal laws.
Surrounding in.liters to a centre draws.”
r.iis law ot nature was illustrated by referring to
the globular shape w Inch the tear o' rain-drop awmir*
in falling through the air. He might have added the
• use of a piece of lead falling flora the lop of a shot
tower, in whirls the very law is practically used to
give to the shot its spherical shape whilst passing from •
the fluid to the solid state. All things, he ao*d, were j
draw n towards the centre of our planet, and our up
and down were ovly relative terras, our up at noon
being the same direction a« our down at midnight._
A reference to the terrestrial globe standing by him
would haw made inis truth plainer to the younger
portion of his hearer*, though it is prolwhU- there was
no one present who did not fully understand him.
( aptllury Attraction received its dtie attention. and
was illustrated by iiumcnn.ig glass tubes ra colored
water, the attraction between the sides of the glass!
and the vvaler causing the Infer to raise in the tube.
This i* an important law of nature, and enters largely
into l.ie economy of vegetation by causing the sap to
raise in the stems of plants and trees Having ex

ter force in contracting cordage, and slated that some
writer* were of opinion that the ancient Egyptians had
availed themselves of the force which it thus exerts;
in raising the great masses of granite to the tops of
■heir pyramids. On first view, this would seem rather ,
1 far-fetched notion, but there is nn instance on record 1 i

The second time in my life, l am inv iu-.l to record
my opinion of the most grand ntid glorious chnractcr
. that ever dignified or adorned the |m«.-s of ln»:ory ;
il,ia* iHutaimte.1 the human mind with the ray*
• >t wisdom. The Saviour of the world came not like
the conquerors of the earth in u triumpliant ear. sur

the proud—he came not like Alexander or Cie-ar, to 1
r:»o u|on ruin, to build in hloutl, tmd trample to the
d» st a thousand thrones, lie runic not like Napolaon. 1
to datrle the eye of the wrotld wiih the magnificence I

n season, that m his diath lie might perpetuate the ,
din trine ot Redemption. How magnificent were Ida ,
motives! flow magnanimous Ins ir.rey! To teach ,
humility to the mighty, he r jnsented to become the i
*<< tf and acorn of the Jew*, when at his nod nations i
kneeling would have I ram hied, had he thrown ofTthe
ve il of fli *h and revealed the majesty of God. Sub- 1 <
nine, indeed, was the spectacle of Inm who rums to ' i
practise the precepts he m<ulrafcd of love and merry. |
and yet on whose It,* bung the dcktmiea of roan and «.
of million* v. t unborn. Meihmk* I see the brilliant |
an I beautiful st ir a* it rise a over Bothiehem. and die •
shouting shepherdsaa they ease on the glorious avmini J

ton in the Temple. And w hether we view him in i.
h-s miraculous birth, or in the brighter hour of bis
triumph over death, hell and the grave, he is the a-,rue ,,
grand and clor.oua character, carrying the evidences •>
ot hia divine original.
Kct ns contemplate for a moment, the insulted and
suffering Saviour expiring on the fro**! Though l.e

‘ ‘ •’Hiibiled bone of the weakness of the man. With ’ i
