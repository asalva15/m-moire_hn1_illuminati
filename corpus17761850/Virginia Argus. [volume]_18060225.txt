FROM THE AURORA.
HOW STANDS THE ACCOUNT* NOW !
llow much must we place to the ere
die. of fa£l—how much to the credit of
stock jobbing— l)ow much to hepe—ami
how much lo despair ? —And how much
to the merit and ccal of Gazette writers,
vvito tarn their bread quantum meruit?
The capture of Vienna is now no Ion
gcr doubted !
And even the defeat of Massena in Ita-,
ly is no lunger believed 1
It is considered as a matter even of;
proud exultation that the aichdnks Char let
had made a “masterly retreat,” (lint is
he made his etca/ir to Laubach or Layback
—it is astonishing with wliat facility the
princes (if modern days make an esea/te !
Let us see where is Layback —(it is an !
ominous name, it is as bad as Jail buck—
or mn back—or run away I)—Tins is not
l.aubach, in the Dutchy of Simmeru on
the Upper I* hint, a few miles from Mentz
—but Layback or Laubach, on the. rivet
Save in Curniola— about 25 miles N« L.
ol 1 rn/ste.
N. 11. Trieste is in the hands of the
French, as well as Geritz and th. icmaitis
of ancient Siquclir..
H was on the first or November (in the
night) that the archduke set out for Lay
back; on his masterly retreat, or as they
tell u», af;er defeating Mcaaena ; this was
twelve daynh: fore the capture of Vienna.
Layback is about 200 miles from Vienna,
which lit* in a diicdVioti somewhat north
of West; and Cracow is about 200 miles
further off, a little more westwaid. It
would seem then that the archduke's on*
ly safe'y is to lay back altogether; or to
go further back, i! he should be pursued;
for forward he cannot go; if Maaacna’a
advance guaid did, as the gazettes say,
pursue hint thither also.
, Meanwhile ylugerniu has given an ac
count of six nr tight thousand of the di
vision of the Aus'ro-Iialiao army which

ol Swisstilaiui ; and who fell into Ange*
reau'» trafi at lircgcr.tz, winch is within 6

scoured the country along the Drove
liotn Clagcnfur h to ihe hr ghborhood of

army of Italy. Count McerftIdt ihe se
cot cl in coimn.i.d it stents had fallen
baek also, or ha i slept aside, uncertain
whether to make a masterly retreat thro'
Jvria or Hungary, or neither Austiia.
Put general Uvult it appears had on the
10th of November fallen in with Meer*
feldt arid put Inm to the route; 'he ge
final and count (like the English gene
rai find piince, and the Austrian prince
geitci.ns) trn.de: a mittcrly retreat accom
panied by a single officer of Huiant.
a
The gcnerat archduke J^hn nir.o
a most masterly retreat f um the Tyro
[lese; leaving 1200 sick anti wounded, and
[ 16,000 muskets to the care of the French
general Ney.
This is the age of retreats ; the march- j
es of major Sturgeon were never ludicroua,
because there was no joke intended “from (
“ Brentford to Elin. from Elin to Acfon,
“ from Aclon to Uxbridge from Mu
nich to Vienna, from Vienna to Znaym,
from Znaym to Brunn, from Brunn to
Troppau, from Troppau to Cracow ; this
| is the route of the German emperor ; a
masterly retreat indeed !
But “ so ! *o !M says the English Ga
zette Royal and extraordinary of the 18th ,
December—there is the battle of IViakau j
in Moravia—27,000 French killed—all
their artillery taken—Bonaparte wound
ed in the sword arm—two horses and 2
aid de-camps killed under him—and that
he retreated afterwards and proposed an
armistice.
This is the sum of the news of the offi
cial bulletin s and we should not be sur
prized to hear of an illumination and tow
er guns being fired, and a general fast,
on the occasion : we recollect, there was
a general illumination, and the low*.rand
park guns were once fired, on the joyful
arid /nova occasion, of llunu/tartt'a aaaaa
aiuution in Egufit.
l-ike the defeat of Massrna it did not
turnout tube true: but it server! the pur
pose ; it kepi John Bull in sulky quiet
ness— promoted the minister’s finance:
and stock jobbing: we should like to
know how much Dundas made by it.
But let us see this terrible affair at IVia
chav.
The English papers, (which of course
i are the best authority in the world !) say
(that the French general Mortier was kil
i led and 12,000 of his troops cut to pieces;
j but the same papers before said hi-, whole
j army amounted tnonly 10 000 man ; as*
I they were cut ufi we may presume they j

; for this, ir. the war of the American rc !
: volution the legs and arms of the Hessi-I
I ans were counted : a whole carcase cost !
|forty pouiids sterling: a leg or an arm aj
; half «>r a fourth of that sum : for the prin
ces it wssa good pocket money calcula
tion, luut for the most/Si'owe king in Chris
tendom : the least said about it the less
disgusting the subj.-fif mus* be.
However tho* bftrtitr (like Bonaparte !
in L ^4<t) wsts killed : he >v 13 on the 12th !

that M01 tier, and Jiernadiitc, and .Milhaud,
' H'.d J~Gtnr8y anil Davoust, and Hauli's di
visions had advanced to Stockerau, and
that they r<-aclied .in tym (which is 35
miles Irotn Vienna and 58 from Ullinuu,
on the 14’h ni November, as the French
ci!l it the 23d Brumairc)—this was three
days after the French, as is said, were de
feated ; the Russians were making n mas.,
ter 14 retreat before them '—heating the':

We find these v.dtoriotn high Jlyeri n

ai that was not far enough) he retreated
to Cracow.

I cull to escape. When in a few days we
! find the vanquished army in possession of
j ilrunn on the 19th November; and not
[only regulating its police but occupying
its fortified places. Brunn contains a po
pulation of 120 000 ; it must be about
twice as large as Philadelphia ; the manu

silk, velvet*, and aJJ.im, must ha-.e fur

and many us/Jul hands lor his manufac

with the horrible in a vety uncommon
way.
However, lie did not stop long at Brunn

I Wischau with two small rivers in the
I rear, securing a retreat, in the event of

| Troftfieit which is ab'nit 40 miles M. T.
of Ohnuiz, and on the Oppa river which
separates Prussia from Austrian Silesia ;
it was occupied only for 13 hours by the
German emperor, who made a curved re
treat, across Prussia Silesia [a melancho
ly march] to Cracow about 133 miles.
It would be cruel to deprive people of
the only consolations of despair, that of a
momentary delusion is too strong to be
easily dissipated ; but it is proper to give
an antidote for that repercussion ; but of
disappointment, which is to follow the
English stock-jobbing bulletin, of 18 De
cember*
The composition of that bulletin, bears
nt>—-not one feature of authenticity—the
account waa a general one—it is sundries
debtor to profit and lass, hut the amount
is not pos’ed ; it may be a good apec, or it
may reduce the chap'a diacount. We are
told “ it appears that a'great battle took
place”—this was a likely thing, and the
favorable position of IVitchau, for a mas
terly retreating army, was such as might
countenance such an expe£lation ; from
the'particular circumstance too, that the
French ware pursuing them ; they say
again ; “ the contest aecma to have befen
most obstinate}” this is very probable,
for an obstinate resistance presupposes a
very impetuous and persevering attaek.
‘‘The Inssofthe French was immense."
This is a matter of course, they are
such careless people, that they do not go
out of the way of shot, and if they will nut
make a v:aaterly retreat, but will stand to
be shot at, why they must be killed.
Eut the best «f ail this bulletin is that
“ the messenger left Olmutz 24 hours af
*’ ter the battle and he tl relatea that it
was reported" what was reported? Why
he relates that it was reported, that the
aiiied pn**ers lost/eev than the French !
Now this is ull a repurl of what was re
ported ; and every body knows what may
be reported!
Hut sir Atthur Paget’s messenger sends
woid ot the same report: and moreover
that Uonupatte proposed an armnttice.
And is inis a new thing ? —Did lie not pro
ji-’.ic an armistice when he was appointed
firstconsul ? D.d he net propose an armis
tice tn Austria, before he entered tho field ?
Hie measuie? of this man arc not like
these o( your light heeledfirince—lie ap
pears destined to reverse every tiling, and
to turn the stupidity of hereditary go
vernments into ridicule and contempt.
He said long ago, that nothing in the.
present crnimy would resemble the last.
There is a tail paragraph to the 'oulle
tin that puts it heyond doubt, what the
object ot the bulletin was—we allude to
what relates to the U0,000 Prussians,
who are said to he in motion ; what kind
of motion, perhaps emotian !
There is one circumstance concerning
this bulletin that fixes its character—.ren
der reft r to the introductory paragraph, it
is in this paper—there it says ori the 18th
Dec. as follows—“ in our last n glit’s pa
per we noticed,” See. This was said on
the evening of the 18th Dec. Then the
account goes on—and “ in the afternoon
(:»1 the 18:h) the following official notice
was circulated, 8cc.
Now this little apparently unimportant
inc dent shews the value of the thing—
who can doubt, that if on the evening of
the 17th the English government had re
ally any news of importance, that it would
have remained till the najet evening un/iub.
imbed—without tower gun», or illuminati
ons ?
I he dslay would be impolitic if there
was goVi news—the apparent delay shews
iner*. was no good news Sc the making of
the nev,* io raise something for « speech
—the report nf the news has at once ser
ved t(. !«ise the fur.dn> and the arrival of
'he messenger, rendering the prospect *f
i «-C!i more remote, depressed the funds
—uei uritm' too bullslm till the stock ex
Chang: cm the 18th—left full
'•me lor deception and stock-jobbing_
Hail the baufeTif Wicshkau been as fatal
to Bonaparte as was represented ; the con
sumption of candies, & oil, and gutipow
il«r, and church steeple music, would
hate been enormous*
As to the remarks upon the bulletin in
die English papers, we will not touch
them ; tiiose who can swallow them, may
lako jalap without a wry face or an emotion.
[Here the Aurora makes some remarks, relative
tn the arming of the 1.tender in the pert oj Ann
Turk, aud then pioceeds at f-jllowx .-J
To return to Europe—we find in some measure
realized occurrences which we have frequently
anticipated—the revolt!a Palatal—iht pibiNOiten
of Bavaria to a kingdom, aud with the addition [
of the Suabntn portion of the house of Lorraine ;
— the separation of Hungary and even of Bohe- j
into, are not impossible tning*—we have keen an j
account of an expedition to South America, and i
the capture of Buenos Ayres on the Rio Plate—« i
let us not be accused of extravagance if we ven- ,
litre toenticipate a consequence ol this event— !
if it should be true that the English have taken i
Buenos Ayres—then is the fate of Poiiti-«ai, de- I
terniined j and we should not be surprised to find
Portugal transferred to Spain and the royal house ;
of Biaganza removed to Brazil—in exchange for '
Portugal, Prance would request that part of j
Spain fronting on the Bay of Biscay, from Hay - J
onne, round l.ape* Ortegal and Finisterre to the
mouth of the Mtrpo\ c.inpreltcnding the hardy
Biscuytn nation, who inhabit Navarre, Biscay,
Astisrsa,*nd Galiaeia, but |u»rticularly possessing
the important maritime and naval ports and po.
sit ions of Finisterre. Co'tmna, Vigo, Ferrol, St, '
Andero, Bilbao, and St. Sebastian
The best illustration of the English bulletin per- j
haps is to be found, in the approach of the seisi
on if parliament, which was to meet on the 17th I
oj Januitty, A month's preparation tor the
king’s speech is full little—and at there are loans
and taxes to be budgeted, what is wanting of
success in the field must be made up in bulletins.
I he rehques of lord Nelson come in good time
for the minister—the circumstances of the fit

very oommotltoukly. I
From the Haiti more Trlgmfihc of the if/J

It was ne"er our wish nor intention, tc
misstate either foreign or domestic occur
rences. We seldom obitucle our owr
, observation* on our readers, uor oiler
speculate on the great events that art
passing in our clay on the theatre of Hu
rope—but simply content ourselves with
. extracting news as we find it, and al
ways cherishing a hope, that whatevet
| may be the jarring of foreign crowned
; heads; whatever quantity of human blood
they may spill, America will ultimately
be a gainer by their disputes. If mail
ambition only is the motives of Bonapar
te’s wars, we wish him disap|*)introent
in the extreme. If, on the contrary, he
fight* for more equal rights on the oceani
which ought to he equally free to all na
I lions, we from our hearts wish him to es
i tnbiigh the freedom of the Sea*.—This is,
! ii»- short, our creed with regard to the
j contending powers in Europe. In fail,
i it is folly in the extreme for American
) printers of newspapers to avoid revealing
or attempt disguising the truth—because
it never fails to happen, that in a fevr
days the truth must come to light; and
whatever may be our private opinions, it
can make no alteration in the great e
venis that have passed, or are about pass
ing before our eyes. Neither king
George, nor any of the continental em
perors, value our individual opinion, nop
the aggregate ofiinion of all the people of
America, a rush. Piiends and neigh
bors, therefore, should carefully guard a
gainsl disputes and quarrel* with each o
ther concerning foreign affairs, which
they cannot regulate as they wish, and n
bout which they should feel no other
anxiety hut what arises from a regard 10
the peace, tranquility, and happiness of
our own country. Those few observations
present themselves, from observing that
our statement of European news on Sa
f turclav- is contravened l»v our hro-tw.r
editors, Messrs. Ysndt and Brown, We
can, however, produce a i espe6lable citi
zen, who will declare noon oath, i! neces
sary, that captain Adams iaicl in the Cus
tom House, that he had seen the accounts
of the defeat of the Russians, as vet
forth in our statement, and that they
were read before him, (at either the
Swedish or Spanish consul's office in Lis
bon.) We rnuvt, thereinie, be dischar
ged front any attempt to mislead the pub
!:c jiidgmat.t. Indeed we are much
misinformed if Mr. Mathew Brown inm
self has not openly declared his belief
that captain Adams’s account is true. If,
therefore, this nts Mr. Brown’s own opi
nion, why take the pains to render our
statement erroneous in the public*? esti
mation ? and the more especially, when
perhaps the vary next mail will place
the matter beyond all conuaditliou, ei
ther one way or the other i
