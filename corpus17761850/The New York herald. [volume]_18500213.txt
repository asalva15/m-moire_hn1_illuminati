The Standard (tory) has very correctly indicated
the fears of the British oligurehy, but it h is no
idea of yielding to the necessity of liberal and
weeding chauges in the Englteh system, which
th# magnificent example ol the F rench republic
has made imperative, lustead o( yielding gracefully
to the spirit of :he age, of which the French
constitution has been the golden fruit, the
Standard advices resibtance and hostility. It
goes for an increase of ihe army and navy, and
of the police, on one aide; and the complete
disarmament and prostration?mora', intellectual
and physical?of the people, on the other. It
approves the Iraud by which, on the first
inhtant, the immense imports in bond awaituig
the fall of the navigation laws, were subjected to
duty atter that day the tame as before , aud it will
very soon demand an order in (Jouucil to su?peud
01 repeal them altogether. It charges ih<tt there is
a league between nil the Iriend* ot liberty, tile
ultra radical*, the chariiata aud the fret- traders;
and cries out in most agoniiiuv tonaa mat th* rallying
cry ol ti?e trade will be changed, if the public
force should be diminished, into " long live the
Britith republic and Cobden for ever "
it hiis bt en thought that at the coming session
there wculd he u drcitled rt taxation of tuc despotji-ni
which exists throughout every jt.irt ot tile Britit-li
sysh in til" policy and institutions; even IreUnd
begins te lo? k up for something I ke a mitigation
ol her servitude. But the indie mona at home are
all to the contriiry, aud one hardly knows whether
to be glad or not to tee the oligarchy bind ag&iu its
huge victim with the immemorial cords. It is probut>le
he w ill be sooner Iree uud< r ihe system of
MVtir compression. The power over hun might
be conhiiued a longer time by mildness, in spite
of French ?n<l Ani> ricau republicanism ; but he
rosy be bound so turht that the muscles *ill burst
bis it it-is by convulsion and at once.
There is < very domestic siun th^t a terrible storm
? h chaise ot lue repr? ? niative system, by which
n House of Commons legislate lor ihe British (ieople
as niucli without (heir mandate as the House
ol Lords; a House of Commons, which is more
romii t srd hostile to the masses, than the < 'hamber
of I* | Lies be lore February, 1.S48?will very
speedily muke its ai'pearauce. The ministry were
ev? n eipectrd to advise It seriously, but they dare
not do so. They could not reiain their places <t
d; > npon any just distribution of the sutlrage, or
any ftiir iippottionment ol the members, even if the
places were, ss now, kept beyond the reach of the
poor and enlightened, by non-payment. Tnauks
to Mr Bright, there will be a fusion ol all reformers,
lor the most utgent demand ot a change in the
repieeentatton of the people of Kii^laud, Ireland
and Scotland ; and no man can tell whether it will
end by violence and suddenly, or bv violence after
postponement. The oligarchy will resist to the
ceaih. The corn laws will be regulated, most
probably, so as to o;>en the way to their repeal.
The pre?ent members of the Commons belong to
the oligarchy, iu ihe pro|>ortion of six-sevenths,
and they will do their bidding : and they will get
the order to obty iheir masters, no matter to what
size the loaf of ine people shrinks, or to what price
it rues. The motal power over the impending
struggle, in which the British system must soon
sink, is in the I'uited States and France,and there
is little danger that it will be forfeited by an Ameman
Cnngies*.
The Russian loan of twenty-seven millions was
taken at once, at a premium, and Mr Cobden's
meeting was ridiculed, ad miuKuni, by the tones,
and their organs, the British press in general.
Some Americans are, probably, also to be louud,

The Loud*u journal* make the cooled announce
mcni iu the world, to the effect that ller Majesty's
representative at St Petersburg ha# offered u facial
treaty of commerce to the autocrat. The particular*
are not oven; but it in said that he look*
upon the otier with a most favorable eye. Oue
can readily atsert, that iu consideration of the ancient
undemanding of the two countries, and the
further stipulatim from Kncland, to yive up Turkey
to the C/.ar, <>n shares, ne will allow his part
of the Euro|ieaii Chinese wall to oj>eii and receive
Briti.-h manufactures. Indeed, without being exceedingly
amiable, he ran well afford, lor such
aniitf winter quarters as Constantinople, to a-iple
ev> n ou Alone hrster cottons, and receive them at
a low aii rafwtm, to be gradually reduced, till, in
fact, no duties shall disturb the sweet amity be
tween the huh contracting parties. That is what
the government of Knt^land wishes, and the manufacturer*
of Knuland are easy to be propitiated, by
wans ol their interests, while the people have
nothing to do with th- transaction. For a consideraiion,
the tones, whirrs, IVal'tes, radicals, of ihe
h ^ h and n.iddl classes, will accept the friendship
or * gieaier power than their own, to whose protection
they have so ignomtmonslv tied several

being a reformer, in the political tense, except the
capacity and the inclination. In applying his mind
to that and kindred subjects, he has been for a long
and useless life toiling against nature. He has

should ever be said that he wits always foremost |

he has extinguished the French revolution by his

periodicals, manuscripts, and glass retorts,
keeping up a red heat in a portable furnace with

"noble friends," and promising addresses,

Nearly a month has elapsed since my last com* I
munication, and a* it is my intention to place before
your readers from time to time, a chronological
review of even's in Italy, it will be necessary
to return to the date of the last letter.
The elections in Piedmont have taken place, and
the result has given a ministerial majority. This
it* a highly important lact, because there ia now no
doubt but that a ?ohd constitutional government
will be established in the most important of the
Italian Sutra. The old Chambers at Turin were
too democratic, and however national and just
tin ir politics, they would have placed his majesty,
Victor hmanuel, m a position which Austria
would have liked, because an offensive policy towards
the Austrian empire might eventually nave
atlorded an excuse for destroytug the repre*?-uialive
irovernment; for it would be useles* to deny
itie fuel, that the double- hearted eagle is a dictator
in the Jtalian peninsula M. Azilio. the Prune
Miulater of the ciibinet, is a true Italian : but he
s?<?the ijec?*?si'y remaining at peace, whilst
the King ot Sardinia, no doubt, looks forward in
the interval, to head that Italian unity, which the
nitrigue* of the petty princes have for the moment
prrvtnud. (ieuoa and Turin ar" still the h >mes
of political rules, snd 1 believe I may say Piedmont
I.ngifliid and the I nited States are the
only lands where tru?- liberty is allowed to breathe.
The p4>rti)on of politic il events in Tuacany has
not in tic h altered since my last letter. The Grind

occasion, ne wsa hissed by the mob, and at I?egi

It has been found nece?n>iry to call in more An*tnsn

In Tuscany, aa well as all other Italian States, the
battle is yet to be fought. Are they to remain

exist, it w ill be coerced by Austrians, and. therefore,
cannot be tree.

We may aay, without much risk of the imputation
of arrogance, that if our readers have not
>ad their eyea open to the deaigns of the Muacoive
Autocrat against the independence ot Turkey,
t has not been our fault. We have again and
igain besought them to give n<> ear to the glozing
alea circulated through the newspapers, here and
Itewhere, that the questiona between the Sultan
ind the Czar were "set at reat." " At rest" they
will never be, except tn that grave which the
Muscovite has long been delving for Turkish inlepend?nce.
We Inst week atated, on the authorty
of continental con.munications, that the Porte
i?d at length given way before ike rude menaces

Ha well aa to "tt?*aiv!" We humbly opine

Czar |?er?isted in hia outrageous d-mands, and sup 01
if d them, not only by hostile meniees, but also
[>y an anned force, all treaties between him.-Hf
and Tutkey, and Kngland aa an ally of Turkey,
were in abeyance, and, for the time, null, void
*nd of no farce. It ia not necessary that actual
collision aha 11 have taken place 10 neutralize treaty
[ ompucts. There ia an easily de tiard interval be*
iwern the state of peace and actual hostilities, in
which all treaties are suspended. Nicholas was
pressing upon the Sultan illegal demands. He was
threatening his neighborterritory with an army,
in esse of non-compliance. He had even military
l?>f#e?*iion of Wallachia and Moldavia, which are,
i r were, part and parcel of the Ottoman Km^ire.
This being notoriously the case, it is absurd, in
ihe highest (leuree, to assume that the Sultan had
no rittnt to rail hi the fleets of his allies for self.
Jefence, or to fancy that these friendly armaments
were violating any faith by entering the Dardanelles
under such circumstances. In such a state
?f things, we repeat, all treaty-compart* become
luspeuded. The law of nations, which all treaties
recoratxe, and which is the foundation of all
reaties whatsoever, was already infringed by ttae
U mauds and attitude of lluseia A clear oisim
nth was already established, if the Cur jarsere
red; snd yet we are. through the Timet, to
'apologise" to thia violator of international law
md custom, because our admiral anchored within

There does not remain the slightest doubt in our
nind that the detention and imprisonment of Koslutb,
at the insum e ot Kus?ia, by the Turkish
iiithorities, are a direct outrage oa the Uw of a*,
ions. How can it be otherwise? Ki>?suth is no
l urkish suhiert. He owes ao natural allegiance

[Frou llw Saatey Tia*s, Jan. SO.J
When the revolutionary muvrmrnt wam at its ft
height in the restot Europe, we confidently fore- Ui
told that it could not fall to produce an echo in ]a
Kuaaia, and the report was shortly afterwards H
presd that a great conspiracy, with democratic 0(
designs, had been organised u? dt. Petershurgh, but *
aceiaruidlly iiiissmI its aim. t*
The h if lory of this conspiracy will never, per- M
baps, be fully knowu; but it appears that a number
of young men?chiefly, it would seem, of noble w
families? having, many of thetn, travelled in the pi
south and wrt-l of Europe, and there ^mbibed
liberal idraa, formed themselves, on their return w
h?me, into a secret society, for the purpose of sub- c
verting the det-poti?ia of the Czar. At tlrat, they b,
contrived to envelop their sittings in complete u,
mystery. The bouses where they met, their cor- ri
respondruce, ibeir eigne, their object, and even |a
their existence, thoroughly escaped the notice of tti
the most vigilant police in the world. oi
From the beginning of the reign of the present al
Czar, who rone into power by usurpation, at the
expense of his brother ConsUmtine, aud by meaua m
ot a sanguinary insurrection and m-tssacre, an nil- bi
mense proportion of the Russian nobility h<tve been h<
aiming at the establishment of a popular uonaUtu- tii
tion. Though decorated with ribands and the in- ]u
signia of various orders, they feel themselves to p,
be no better than a superior class ot slaves, in pi
which light they are regarded by the government. ?
No wonder, therefore, that the more youthful M
umong their order should have joined the secret tl
society mentioned above, the object ot which wa< ( |
to establish a constitutional government, in<>4t K
probably of a republican form, but undoubtedly 0I
011 aristocratic principles, since the people in Ui
Russia are too destitute ot education to have m
any notion of political righu. Every diliicul- jn
ty is thrown in the way of discovering to ti<
what extent the conspiracy pervaded the no- B(
bility; but to all appearance there are few fa- fu
milies in the empire not in some way or other to
connected with it. When It was to have broken CI
our whm [Wirt I on nf the urinv h:iH imiieil it nr urha
were the resources of the conspirators, may be du p
covered hereafter, when U will also appear by wha jg
kind of treachery the tint hint of the design wa 0,
communicated to governme.it. Alter this disco
very was made, the probability is that the blow was x
instantaneously struck, it would not be safe ia
Kust-ia to nurse a conspiracy by artificial means;
because, where a despotism exists, in spite of spies,
informers, and traitors, the government is sure to HI
remain in profound ignorance of innumerable things P'
which are made known in other countries by the "J
press. It is a saying in France, that.meu conspire
in the open streets; but in Russia the thing is car- e,
ried on by the fireside, with cloied doors, domes- *1
tics excluded, and among the most sacred symbols ?j
of purity and religion. Fathers and sons, brothers, pi
cousins, end persons connected by the ties of M
marriage, inspired by the principles of justice and "
humanity, unite themselves by oath to strike a blow JV
at tyranny. ,t
In the present case, the meetings of the conspira- |d
tors were h? Id by night, after ih>> manner in which jt
rhe Orleanicts, Martinists, and Illuminati met, to- el
ward the close ol the last century, in France and ?l
Germany, while members of the society were sta- ?
tioned with drawn swords at the doors of the
houses, and on every landing-place on the flight of ^
sinirs leading to the place of meeting, tiome un- ^
fortunate accident may have revealea the existence u
of the conspiracy to the government, or a aingle in
traitor may have been found, who, with the hope i*
of self aggrandizement, sold his companions. In a
whatever way the truth came to light, the Court P"
obtained information of the conspiracy, and with a<
the vigor and violence for which the great northern it
despotum has always been, like all others, remark- p,
able, it proceeded to make its seizures and inock ga
trials, whether any papers fell into its hands or n?
not, remains doubtlul, though there is one fact r?
wl.ich would lead us to believe thut some doeu- 1*
ments must have been found?we mean the discovery
made of the immense number of those en- ?*
gaged in ihe design. f *
inconsequence, the government was compelled ,r
to select its victims, of whom to make an exam- to
pie. These were tried by a military secret tribu- co
nal, and, as a matter of course, precipitately con- pr
demned to death. But despotism is politic as well *
as sanguinary. By the execution of these pernios, tl<
the whole of their relatives and friends would have
been converted into permanent conspirators, burnisg
with the thirst of vengeance. For this reason, pt
the sentences of the condemned were commuted tb
in some ca&ea into exile to tiiberu, where they rrt
are to work the mines in chains; in other cases pr
into confinement in remote fortresses, where they
will die a lingering death; in other cases, again, ot
to forced service in the army, where they will '
enher convert their fellow soldiers, or become the
obiects ot their iwrseverivg scorn and contempt. ?b
But, with that exquisite cruelty which tyrants on
always practise, the condemned are all to be kept c?
in ignorance of this mitigation of their punish- ib
ment, and to be paraded to the gallows, or the ,b
block, as it for execution, wheu what is called the B"
Emperor's clemency will be revealed to them.
One curious circumstsnce in this affair should not m
be overlooked. By the military secret tribunals t(l
they were all coodemned t? death, though it has
no* , we are told, been discovered that tneir dt> in
grees of guilt were various, in consequence of
which their secondary punishment is also t* be n>
vaiitd They who are most obnoxious to despot- 'jj
ism?which is meant by asuperior.d- gree of guilt?
are to be sent to the mint?, where tney will meet ^
with a liugenng death instead of an instantaneous g,
one. Thev whoee virtues are of a less positive ?
stamp, will be confined in dungeons, aud let rot or A

courage; whilr the third and lowest class will be '
