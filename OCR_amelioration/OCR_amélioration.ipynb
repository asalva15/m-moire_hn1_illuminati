    "That there should exist in this free and enlightened country the sentiments imputed to our Jacobins, so extremely hostile to all religion, and to every regular constituted Government, and so daringly bent on the propagation of revolutionary principles, has excited the wonder, and purged the understandings of our profoundest politicians. The publication of Robinson's Proofs of a Conspiracy, in my opinion, removes every doubt. This author, deserving of the patronage of every American, has traced this passion for innovation to its true source, and solemnly warned us of what unthinking mortals very little expect. I will endeavor, for the benefit of your readers, to trace in these proofs the present disorders of the world.\n",

    "The nations of Europe have been infested for about a century past with a set of philosophers and reformers, who, under the mask of liberty and liberality of sentiment, have endeavored to subvert all government, and to annihilate all religion; and Voltaire, Helvetius, and Condorcet, are of this description. Whoever reads their works, though clothed in all the charms of wit and fancy, must be convinced of their tendency to this one point. The fatal malaria of revolution, which has filled the world with blood and tears, was generated by these men; and some of them lived to witness the success of their labors. They constantly held up to view a kind of Utopian felicity, distant, yet sure, whenever mankind could exempt themselves from the fetters of religion, and the impositions of legal restraints; and they adopted and regulated their conduct by this maxim, that the end projected would sanctify the means necessary to accomplish it. We will now explain this end and these means, and also hint at their origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam Weishaupt, a professor in the University at Ingolstadt in Bavaria, about the year 1765, invented a plan, calculated, as he conceived, to destroy by a slow and subtle operation all the religions and governments in the world. His object was to free man from all restraints whatever, except that of his reason, and to reduce all nations to their primitive simplicity. For this purpose he gave his pernicious doctrine the name of Masonry—which was calculated to avoid suspicion, and to facilitate his designs. He therefore made his court to real Masons—informed them that he was able to confer on them a great number of degrees (which by the bye were of his own invention) not as yet known among them. To each of these degrees he attached dazzling symbols and literals, calculated to captivate the fancy, and to create a desire for further knowledge in the art. Several of the first degrees were intended only to instill into the mind a peculiar mode of thinking, favorable to his plan; and by the time the candidate was introduced into the Illuminati degree, he was fit for every evil work. Here the great design of Weishaupt was fully unfolded—and from a regular progress in the corruption of the heart, his pupils saw no cause to repent of their illumination. These lodges were formed and established over all Germany and France before the malignancy of their principles were discovered. The great founder of the order did not stop here. He procured men of his own principles to be placed over most of the seminaries of learning, so as to corrupt the morals of the rising generation. He promoted the establishment of female lodges, in which the same sentiments were inculcated, well knowing that the softer sex have an almost invincible control over the conduct of men. Printers and booksellers were seized with the mania, and had a remarkable influence. Thus this inhuman projector of national distresses, deceived the true Masons—and by this very deception eventually inflamed all Europe with revolutionary principles, and with an utter detestation of religion and morality—and transformed them into brutes and atheists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous to the commencement of the French revolution, the lodges in France had received all the new-fangled degrees of Weishaupt, except that of the Illuminati. The dawn of political troubles in that country, induced them to send a solemn deputation to the German lodges, and to request a conferment of this exalted degree in masonry. Deputies were sent from Germany to Paris to inaugurate their brethren into the secret mysteries of the Illuminati—which wholly consisted in political and religious disputes and in plans to destroy the monarchy of France, and in the place of order and civil rule to substitute a legal system of atheism, plunder and rapine. The more fully to effect these purposes, each lodge in France deputed a committee to meet in the Hall of the Jacobin friars, to discuss political and religious subjects—to give a tone to the nation, and to influence the national convention, which had then began to assume the character of a legislative and permanent body. Here then we have the origin of French Jacobins, and the incentives by which they are governed. They are the pupils of Weishaupt, and the professed advocates of Atheism, of robbery, plunder and murder!\n",
    "\n",
    "One truth is yet to be told, but little known in this country, which is, that Talleyrand, the present minister of exterior relations, and the inveterate despoiler of American property and fame, was the second officer in these Illuminated lodges, and the principal spoke in the wheel of French politics. By his means, joined to the exertions of Orleans and Mirabeau, all the leaders in the national convention were initiated into this society—which gave a preponderance to every measure proposed in the public councils. Hence many of their decrees are clothed in the very language of Weishaupt. Witness the one against religion, by which all kinds of homage to the Deity is denounced as a cheat, and forbidden—and atheism established as the creed of Frenchmen.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the nature of these principles, and the effect they have had in accelerating the nations of Europe to the very apex of disorder and distress, we may easily discover the origin of Jacobins, and the opposition to executive measures in this country. I know that our Jacobins disclaim even the most distant relation to the French fraternizers, and affect to despise them—and I do not pretend to say, that there is any direct communication between them, except it be with the leaders of the two nations—who by plans formed in secret and under cover of night, imperceptibly direct all the movements in the great scheme of revolution. This fell curse has already awakened the world to arms;—England, France, and America, have felt the effects of it—and Holland, Geneva, Switzerland, and the capital of Italy have fallen victims to it. These principles spread like a contagious sickness—we are secretly impelled to plot the destruction of all religion and government without knowing the cause;—and the Jacobins of this country are the faithful disciples of the European Illuminati. I turn with disgust from this horrid picture of human depravity, and pray to God for the restoration of peace.\n",
